# üêî Chicken Weight Prediction from Images (ResNet18)
This project explores how deep learning can be applied to predict the weight of chickens from their images ‚Äî combining computer vision with regression modeling. Built as part of a technical challenge by Livestockify, the idea was to create an intuitive, scalable solution for poultry weight estimation using only images.

# The Goal
The aim was simple but ambitious:
Can a model look at a chicken and predict its weight in kilograms ‚Äî just from an image?

With no real-world weight labels available, we simulated a realistic scenario using synthetic data and trained a model using transfer learning with ResNet18.

## Dataset Creation
Since actual weights weren‚Äôt available, we:

Loaded all .jpg images from a directory.

Assigned synthetic weights using numpy.linspace(1.0, 3.0) to evenly spread values.

Added Gaussian noise to mimic real-life variations and imperfections.

A custom PyTorch Dataset class (ChickenWeightDataset) handled all loading, transformation, and pairing of images with their corresponding labels.

## Preprocessing
Images resized to 224√ó224 pixels to suit ResNet18‚Äôs input format.

Applied normalization using standard ImageNet stats.

Data split into 80% training and 20% validation.

## Model Architecture
We used ResNet18, a lightweight but powerful convolutional neural network. Key modifications:

Loaded pretrained weights from ImageNet.

Replaced the final classification layer with a single output neuron for regression.

This allowed the model to output a continuous value ‚Äî representing the predicted weight of a chicken in kg.

## Training & Optimization
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Optimizer: Adam with a learning rate of 0.001

Epochs: 15

At each epoch:

Training and validation losses were recorded.

Gradient updates were performed on training data.

Validation loss was calculated using torch.no_grad() for efficiency.

## Evaluation & Visualization
We evaluated model performance using both quantitative and visual metrics.

## R¬≤ Score
Achieved an R¬≤ score of 0.7041, indicating a strong correlation between predicted and actual weights.

## Loss Curves
Plotted training and validation losses over epochs to track model convergence and ensure no overfitting.

## Prediction Samples
Displayed actual vs. predicted weights directly on validation images. This gave a clear, intuitive sense of how well the model was performing visually.

## Scatter Plot
Plotted predicted weights against actual weights with a red diagonal line representing ideal predictions. Closer clustering along the line = better accuracy.

## Residual Histogram
Visualized the distribution of prediction errors (actual - predicted). A centered histogram around zero suggested unbiased predictions.

## Summary
Successfully trained a CNN model to predict chicken weight from images using transfer learning.

Achieved a high R¬≤ score and low validation loss.

Synthetic labels worked well as a stand-in for real-world data, providing a solid foundation.

Visual and statistical evaluations confirmed the model‚Äôs ability to learn meaningful features related to weight.

## Key Takeaways
Transfer learning is a powerful technique even for regression tasks.

Simulated data, when crafted thoughtfully, can be a useful stand-in for real-world scenarios.

This model offers a promising step toward practical, camera-based poultry weight estimation in real farm environments.
